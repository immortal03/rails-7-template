# class Rack::Attack
#   ### Configure Cache ###
#
#   # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
#   # configure it here.
#   #
#   # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blocklisting and
#   # safelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
#   # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store
#
#   Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new
#
#   throttle("req/ip", limit: 10, period: 1.second) do |req|
#     req.ip
#   end
#
#   Rack::Attack.safelist "allow localhost" do |req|
#     req.ip == "127.0.0.1" || req.ip == "::1"
#   end
# end
